Explanation B:

 class Employee does not override Object class equals method in proper way, 
 proper way to implement the equals method is in below:
 
 	@Override
	public boolean equals(Object obj) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		if (obj == null || !(obj instanceof Employee)) {
			return false;
		}
		Employee e = (Employee) obj;
		return e.name.equals(name) && e.salary == salary;
	}
