Explanation D:
         Here, Employee class is mutable, where property 'visited' can be changed from outside of the class.
         Employee class override methods equals() and hashCode() with all three properties name, salary and
         visited but during runtime inside method removeDuplicates() of EmployeeIfo, visited property has been
         reset to true for the Employee objects which have been visited already.
         But, dupsRemoved list has all the Employee objects with visited = false.

         Now, while, comparing Employee objects with HashMap.containsKey(), it calls method equals and hashCode
         which also compare visited property which always result in false.

         Best practice : if a certain property of a class can change during runtime, we can exclude
         that property from equals and hashCode overriding methods.
