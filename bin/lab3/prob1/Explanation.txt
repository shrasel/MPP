We know that 

Subclass instanceof Superclass is ture but 
Superclass instanceof Subclass is false;


p1.equals(p2)? false
Because p1 is subclass of p2. It has his own operation, attributes , etc.
So p1 doesn't  equal p2.

p2.equals(p1)? true
p2 is superclass. p1 extends all of operations and attributes of P2. So p1 has p2's  all of operations and attributes.
So p2 equals p1
