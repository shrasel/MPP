Explanation C:
      
      In EmployeeInfo class, HashMap has been used to keep track of which Employee objects 
      have been duplicated. And HashMap.containsKey() used in this method call
      element1.hashcode.equals(element2.hashcode) method of default Object superclass 
      and hashCode() method is not overridden in Employee sub class.
      If we do not override this method then default hashCode() method 
      calculates different hash codes for different objects with same value as well.

      If we override hashCode in Employee class as in my implementation, it works.
